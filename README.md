Introduction to AI - Training a linear classifier from scratch vs with a ML toolbox
In this project, we trained a linear classifier on the iris dataset by first analyzing the data, create a simple neural network using logistic regression, calculating mean squared error, and optimizing our weights using gradient descent in order to better grasp the concepts and then used scikit-learn implemented functions.
